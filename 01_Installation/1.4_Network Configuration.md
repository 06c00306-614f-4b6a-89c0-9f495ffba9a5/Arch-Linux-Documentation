## ðŸ“¡ Network Configuration

### 1. Critical: Enable Network Services

**ESSENTIAL FIRST STEP** - This is often missed in other guides:

```bash
# Enable the DHCP client daemon - CRITICAL STEP
systemctl enable --now dhcpcd.service
```

### 2. Establish Internet Connection

#### Option A: Wired Connection

Wired connections should work automatically after enabling dhcpcd. Verify with:

```bash
# Check if your interface has an IP address
ip addr show

# If needed, bring up the interface manually (replace enp0s3 with your interface name)
ip link set enp0s3 up

# Request IP via DHCP if needed
dhclient enp0s3
```

#### Option B: Wireless Connection

For WiFi connections:

```bash
# Enable and start the wireless daemon
systemctl enable --now iwd.service

# Launch the interactive wireless tool
iwctl

# Inside the iwctl prompt, enter these commands one by one:
device list                          # Find your wireless device name (e.g., wlan0)
station wlan0 scan                   # Scan for networks (replace wlan0 with your device)
station wlan0 get-networks           # List available networks
station wlan0 connect "NetworkName"  # Connect to your network (will prompt for password)
exit                                 # Exit the tool

# Verify interface status
ip addr show
```

### 3. Verify Internet Connectivity

```bash
# Try to ping a reliable server
ping -c 4 archlinux.org
```

If ping fails, troubleshoot using these steps:

1. Check if DHCP is running:
   ```bash
   systemctl status dhcpcd
   ```

2. Verify that your interface has an IP address:
   ```bash
   ip addr
   ```

3. Test DNS resolution:
   ```bash
   ping -c 4 8.8.8.8  # If this works but archlinux.org doesn't, you have DNS issues
   ```

4. For DNS issues, create a temporary resolv.conf:
   ```bash
   echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" > /etc/resolv.conf
   ```

### 4. Update System Clock

Synchronize the system clock:

```bash
# Enable time synchronization
timedatectl set-ntp true

# Verify status
timedatectl status  # Should show "System clock synchronized: yes"
```

### 5. Optimize Package Mirrors

Configure the fastest mirrors for better download speeds:

```bash
# Install reflector
pacman -Sy reflector

# Backup the original mirrorlist
cp /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist.backup

# Update mirrorlist with fastest mirrors
# Replace 'US' with your country code or remove for worldwide mirrors
reflector --country US --age 12 --protocol https --sort rate --save /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist

# Verify the updated mirrorlist
head -n 5 /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
```
