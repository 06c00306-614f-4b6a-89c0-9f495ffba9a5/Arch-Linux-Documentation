## ðŸ“¦ Base System Installation

### 1. Update Package Databases

Ensure package databases are up to date:

```bash
pacman -Sy
```

### 2. Install Essential Packages

Install the base system and essential components:

```bash
# Install base system, kernel, firmware, and development tools
pacstrap /mnt base linux linux-firmware base-devel

# Install text editors (at least one is recommended)
pacstrap /mnt vim nano

# Install man pages and documentation
pacstrap /mnt man-db man-pages texinfo

# Install CPU microcode updates (choose ONE based on your CPU)
pacstrap /mnt intel-ucode   # For Intel CPUs
# OR
pacstrap /mnt amd-ucode     # For AMD CPUs

# Install networking tools
pacstrap /mnt networkmanager dhcpcd iwd
```

> ðŸ’¼ **Professional Note**: This step will take several minutes (5-20) depending on your internet speed and system performance. This is a good time to review the next steps.

### 3. Generate File System Table (fstab)

Generate the fstab file, which defines how partitions are mounted at boot:

```bash
# Generate fstab using UUID identifiers (recommended)
genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab

# Review the generated fstab file for correctness
cat /mnt/etc/fstab
```

The output should show entries for both your root and EFI partitions with their UUIDs, filesystem types, and mount options.

### 4. Enter the New System (chroot)

Change root into the newly installed system:

```bash
arch-chroot /mnt
```

Your command prompt should change, indicating you're now working inside your new Arch Linux installation. All commands from this point forward will affect your installed system, not the live environment.
