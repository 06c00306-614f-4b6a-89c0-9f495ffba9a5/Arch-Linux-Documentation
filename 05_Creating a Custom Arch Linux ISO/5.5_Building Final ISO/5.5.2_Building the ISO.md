## Building the ISO

### Clean Build Environment

Start with a clean build environment to avoid issues from previous builds:

```bash
# Remove previous work directory to ensure clean build
sudo rm -rf ~/archiso-build/work/

# Create fresh directories
mkdir -p ~/archiso-build/work ~/archiso-build/out
```

### Build Process

Build the final ISO with detailed output:

```bash
cd ~/archiso-build

# Build with verbose output
sudo mkarchiso -v -w work/ -o out/ releng/
```

The build process involves these steps:
1. Installing packages to the work directory
2. Configuring the system according to your customizations
3. Creating SquashFS images
4. Creating an ISO-9660 image with proper boot configuration

This process may take 30-90 minutes depending on your system specifications and internet speed.

### Build Completion

After a successful build, you'll find your ISO in the `out` directory:

```bash
ls -lh ~/archiso-build/out/
```

The filename will typically follow this pattern:
```
custom-arch-YYYY.MM.DD-x86_64.iso
```

Make note of the ISO size and creation date for your records.
