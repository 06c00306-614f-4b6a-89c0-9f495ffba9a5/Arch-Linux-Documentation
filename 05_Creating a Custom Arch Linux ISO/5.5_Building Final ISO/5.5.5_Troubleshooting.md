## Troubleshooting

### Common Build Issues

#### Out of Space Errors

If you encounter "No space left on device" errors:

```bash
# Check available space
df -h

# Create work directory on a drive with more space
sudo mkarchiso -v -w /path/with/space/work/ -o ~/archiso-build/out/ releng/
```

#### Missing Package Errors

If packages are missing from repositories:

```bash
# Verify package availability
pacman -Ss package_name

# If a package is unavailable, either:
# 1. Remove it from packages.x86_64, or
# 2. Replace it with an alternative, or
# 3. Build it yourself and add to a custom repo
```

#### Failed Build Process

If the build fails:

```bash
# Check logs
cat ~/archiso-build/work/build.log

# Common issues:
# - Package conflicts
# - Insufficient permissions
# - Network connectivity problems
```

### Installation Issues

For installation issues discovered during testing:

#### Bootloader Problems

If the bootloader fails to install or boot:

1. Check Calamares bootloader configuration
2. Verify GRUB package is included
3. Test with different partition schemes

#### Calamares Crashes

If Calamares crashes during installation:

1. Check Calamares logs in `/tmp/calamares.log` during live session
2. Verify all required dependencies are installed
3. Check module configurations for errors
