## Distribution Best Practices

### Documentation

Create comprehensive documentation for your distribution:

1. **README.md**: Overview, features, and basic instructions
2. **Installation Guide**: Step-by-step installation instructions
3. **Post-Installation Guide**: Configuration after installation
4. **FAQ**: Common questions and answers
5. **Troubleshooting**: Solutions for common issues

### Distribution Platform

Consider these platforms for distributing your ISO:

1. **GitHub Releases**: Upload ISO and checksum files
2. **SourceForge**: Popular for Linux distribution hosting
3. **OSDN**: Another platform focused on open source projects
4. **Your Own Website/Server**: For complete control

### Release Notes

Create detailed release notes for each version:

```bash
# Example release notes structure
nano ~/archiso-build/release-notes.md
```

Include:
- Version number and release date
- New features and improvements
- Fixed issues from previous versions
- Known issues and limitations
- Installation instructions
- Upgrade instructions (if applicable)
- Credits and acknowledgments
