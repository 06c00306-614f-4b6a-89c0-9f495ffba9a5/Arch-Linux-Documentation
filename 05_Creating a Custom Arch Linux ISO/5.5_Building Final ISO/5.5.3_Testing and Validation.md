## Testing and Validation

### ISO Verification

Verify the integrity of your ISO file:

```bash
# Generate checksums
cd ~/archiso-build/out/
sha256sum custom-arch-*.iso > custom-arch.sha256
md5sum custom-arch-*.iso > custom-arch.md5
```

### Virtual Machine Testing

Before distributing, thoroughly test the ISO in virtual machines:

#### QEMU Testing (Quick Test)

```bash
# Install QEMU if not already installed
sudo pacman -S qemu-desktop

# Test with UEFI firmware (recommended)
qemu-system-x86_64 -boot d -cdrom ~/archiso-build/out/custom-arch-*.iso \
  -m 2G -enable-kvm \
  -bios /usr/share/ovmf/x64/OVMF.fd

# Test with legacy BIOS (for compatibility)
qemu-system-x86_64 -boot d -cdrom ~/archiso-build/out/custom-arch-*.iso \
  -m 2G -enable-kvm
```

#### VirtualBox Testing (More Thorough)

1. Install VirtualBox on your host system
2. Create a new virtual machine:
   - Type: Linux
   - Version: Arch Linux (64-bit)
   - Memory: 2048 MB or more
   - Hard disk: Create a virtual hard disk (20 GB or more)
3. Enable EFI in VM settings (optional, to test UEFI boot)
4. Configure the VM to boot from the ISO
5. Start the VM and test the live environment
6. Run the Calamares installer and perform a full installation
7. Reboot after installation and verify the system boots properly

### Installation Testing

During virtual machine testing, pay close attention to these aspects:

1. **Boot Process**:
   - Does the system boot in both UEFI and BIOS modes?
   - Are boot splash screens displayed properly?
   - Are boot parameters working correctly?

2. **Live Environment**:
   - Does the desktop environment load properly?
   - Are all included applications functioning?
   - Is networking configured correctly?
   - Does the welcome application launch?

3. **Calamares Installer**:
   - Does Calamares launch correctly?
   - Do all installation steps work as expected?
   - Does partitioning work properly?
   - Is user creation functioning?
   - Does bootloader installation succeed?

4. **Post-Installation**:
   - Does the installed system boot correctly?
   - Are all expected configurations applied?
   - Does networking work in the installed system?
   - Are user settings and files properly configured?

Document any issues you encounter for later fixes.
