## Testing Calamares Configuration

Before building the final ISO, it's a good idea to test your Calamares configuration:

```bash
# If you have Calamares installed on your development system:
sudo calamares -d -c /path/to/archiso-build/releng/airootfs/etc/calamares/settings.conf
```

This will run Calamares in debug mode with your custom configuration, allowing you to verify it works before building the ISO.
