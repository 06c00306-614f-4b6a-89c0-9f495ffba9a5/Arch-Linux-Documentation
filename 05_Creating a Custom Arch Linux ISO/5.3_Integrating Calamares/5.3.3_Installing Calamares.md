## Installing Calamares

Calamares can be installed from the Arch repositories or built from source. For simplicity, we'll use the repository version.

### Option 1: Using the Repository Version

Since we added Calamares to the packages list, it will be installed during ISO creation. We now need to configure it.

### Option 2: Building from Source (Optional, for Advanced Customization)

If you need the latest features or specific modifications:

```bash
cd ~/archiso-build/calamares

# Clone Calamares repository
git clone https://github.com/calamares/calamares.git
cd calamares

# Create build directory
mkdir build
cd build

# Configure and build
cmake .. \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr \
    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR=lib \
    -DSKIP_MODULES="webview tracking interactiveterminal initramfs initramfscfg \
                   dracut dracutlukscfg \
                   dummyprocess dummypython dummycpp \
                   dummypythonqt services-openrc"

make -j$(nproc)

# Note: We won't install it to the host system
# Instead, create a package to include in the ISO
```
