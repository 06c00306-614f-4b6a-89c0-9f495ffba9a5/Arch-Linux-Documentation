## Setting Up the Build Environment

Create a dedicated working directory for your ISO build:

```bash
# Create main working directory
mkdir -p ~/archiso-build
cd ~/archiso-build

# Create subdirectories
mkdir -p {calamares,custom-packages,airootfs-overlay}
```

Choose a baseline profile to start from:

```bash
# Copy the releng (release engineering) profile as a starting point
cp -r /usr/share/archiso/configs/releng/ ./

# Backup original configuration files
mkdir original-configs
cp releng/profiledef.sh releng/packages.x86_64 original-configs/
```
