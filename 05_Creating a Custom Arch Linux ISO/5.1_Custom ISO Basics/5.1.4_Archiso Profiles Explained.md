## Archiso Profiles Explained

Arch Linux provides two main profiles in `/usr/share/archiso/configs/`:

1. **releng** (Release Engineering): Used to build the official monthly Arch ISO. Contains a minimal but functional live environment with basic tools.

2. **baseline**: An even more minimal profile with fewer packages.

For a custom distribution with a graphical installer, the `releng` profile is the better starting point.

### Key Profile Components

- **profiledef.sh**: Defines ISO properties (name, version, installation media configuration)
- **packages.x86_64**: List of packages to include in the ISO
- **pacman.conf**: Package manager configuration for the live environment
- **airootfs/**: Files to be placed in the root filesystem of the live environment
- **efiboot/**: EFI boot loader configuration
- **syslinux/**: Legacy boot loader configuration
