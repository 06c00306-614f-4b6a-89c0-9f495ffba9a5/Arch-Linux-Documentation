## Building the Base ISO

Now build the base ISO:

```bash
# Create build and output directories
mkdir -p ~/archiso-build/work ~/archiso-build/out

# Build the ISO
cd ~/archiso-build
sudo mkarchiso -v -w work/ -o out/ releng/
```

This process will:
1. Install packages to a work directory
2. Configure the system according to your customizations
3. Create SquashFS images
4. Generate the bootable ISO

The build process may take 30-60 minutes depending on your system and internet speed.
