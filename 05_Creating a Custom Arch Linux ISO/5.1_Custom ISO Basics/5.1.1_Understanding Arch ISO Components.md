## Understanding Arch ISO Components

An Arch Linux ISO consists of several key components:

1. **Boot Loader**: Handles initial system startup (GRUB or systemd-boot)
2. **Kernel and Initramfs**: Core components that initialize the system
3. **SquashFS Filesystem**: Compressed filesystem containing the live environment
4. **Package Collection**: Software included in the live environment
5. **Installation System**: Tools for installing to disk (traditionally command-line or, in our case, Calamares)

The build process creates these components and packages them into a bootable ISO file. The `archiso` tool handles most of the technical details, allowing you to focus on customization.
